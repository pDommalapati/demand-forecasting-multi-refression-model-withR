# Demand Forecasting with ML (used four regression Models)


**What this project is**
I worked with a team to predict which styles and products would fly off the shelves for a major apparel retailer. Using a five-year Kaggle dataset, we combined exploratory analysis with four machine-learning models to forecast demand and minimize waste.

**My role & approach**
I led data cleaning and feature engineering—creating a “price×discount” interaction metric and handling stock-out flags. We tested Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors, comparing each model’s accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores.

**Key achievements**

Found KNN delivered 100% accuracy on our hold-out set, capturing non-linear effects of price and season.

Demonstrated that wish-list counts had minimal impact, refocusing inventory strategies on discounts and pricing.

Recommended dynamic pricing and inventory prioritization for high-demand items.

**Impact & takeaways**
Our insights offered the retailer a clear path to reduce $500B in global unsold fashion inventory, boost revenue, and shrink environmental waste. I honed my skills in model comparison and translating technical results into ethical, actionable business moves.
